**Evidence-backed code review. Static-first, probe-driven, and gated.**

The skill source lives in [`skills/code-review/`](skills/code-review/), independently of any host's installation directory. The current version is a beta release; see [VERSION](VERSION).

Most AI reviews stop at “this looks risky.” This skill produces a review you can audit: every finding points to a location, a contract or code path, and a severity; every gate decision is rendered from machine-readable JSON. It reads the diff, surrounding source, tests, and project rules — no build, test run, or coverage report required.

It never modifies the code under review.

## Latest news

<!-- NEWS:START -->
### v0.1.0-beta.3 (2026-10-31)

#### Removed

- Removed the independent reviewer and its Claude Code/Codex adapters. The four
  probes now feed the report and gate directly from raw findings; `reviewer.json`,
  `review-mode`, and reviewer-adapter installation are no longer used.

#### Changed

- The installer now installs only the host skill layout. `--agent` selects the
  Claude Code or Codex skill directory, not a reviewer adapter.

## Release status

`v0.1.0-beta.3` — this is a test release. The probe contract, report schema, and
gate behavior may change before 1.0.

- **Severity is three levels:** `high`, `medium`, `low`. Records written by the
  earlier four-level version, including any `critical` value, are **not
  compatible**; `collect-metrics` rejects them. Re-run the review or migrate the
  records before using them with this release.
- **Scope:** static-first review with four probes and JSON-derived report/gate
  output. It does not replace tests, CI, or human review.
- **Validation:** 49 offline pipeline, NEWS, and installation tests; clean-project
  end-to-end gate runs; additional probe smokes. These are regression checks,
  not a general recall claim. Concurrency-defect detection has not been
  validated.

## Why this skill

| | |
|---|---|
| **Static-first** | Works on a fresh clone or a partial checkout. Coverage is optional, not a prerequisite. |
| **Evidence contract** | A finding without a location, summary, and checkable evidence is not a finding. |
| **Four probes** | Behavior, tests, rules, and impact are separate questions with separate reports. |
| **Machine-checkable gate** | Counts and blockers come from JSON, not from prose the model retyped. |
| **Auditable output** | The human report and the JSON records are rendered from the same source and verified against each other. |

## Quick start

### Install

Run this command **inside your project**:

```bash
npx -y skills add kyy-logs/code-review-skill --agent codex --skill code-review --yes
```

Use `--agent claude-code` for Claude Code. Codex installs to `.agents/skills/code-review/`; Claude Code installs to `.claude/skills/code-review/`. Node.js 22.20+ is required. This installs only the skill; there is no separate reviewer adapter.

### Run

Ask in Claude Code:

```text
Review these changes with code-review.
```

Or invoke the skill directly:

```text
/code-review
```

For a fixed range:

```text
Use code-review on commits abc123..def456
```

The skill supports two review modes:

- `worktree` — staged, unstaged, and untracked changes against the current `HEAD`.
- `commits` — a fixed `base..head` range.

### Read the result

```text
docs/work/active/{slug}/
├── code-review.md      # human report
└── probes/
    ├── behavior-review.json
    ├── test-coverage.json
    ├── repo-guard.json
    └── impact-analysis.json
```

## How it works

```text
scope ──► probes ──► sync ──► reconcile ──► report ──► gate
```

1. **Scope** — determine `worktree` or `commits`; record base and head as commit IDs.
2. **Probes** — dispatch four independent agents with the same scope and diff, each writing its own probe JSON. Run in batches if host capacity is limited, or record a serial fallback if agents are unavailable. Cross-probe duplicates are retained and counted; actual speed and token savings remain unverified.
3. **Sync** — validate probe JSON and derive counts with `collect-metrics`.
4. **Reconcile** — high findings must be closed or marked false-positive by the probe.
5. **Report** — render the human report’s fact sections from JSON, then verify them.
6. **Gate** — required-probe failures and open high findings block the merge.

### The four probes

| Probe | Required | Question it answers |
|---|---|---|
| `behavior-review` | yes | Does the changed behavior match its actual contract and implementation path? |
| `test-coverage` | yes | Are the tests meaningful, and is incremental coverage measured when data exists? |
| `repo-guard` | yes | Does the change violate repository or project rules? |
| `impact-analysis` | no | Who calls this, what contracts change, and what is the performance/architecture blast radius? |

Probes are intentionally narrow. `behavior-review` is not a linter, and `repo-guard` is not a general bug scanner.

## Evidence contract

Every finding records:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `location` | `path:line`, or file level with a reason |
| `summary` | What is wrong — not “consider improving” |
| `evidence` | Contract, code path, test output, or rule ID |
| `severity` | `high` / `medium` / `low` |
| `status` | `open` / `reconciled` / `wontfix` / `false-positive` |

High-severity findings must cite the actual method signature and the contract they violate, or a concrete code path. A hunch is capped at `medium` until the evidence is checked.

## Configuration

`references/probes.yaml` controls the probe registry:

Project-specific rules can live in `.code-review/rules/`, or be pointed to with `CODE_REVIEW_RULES_DIR`:

```bash
export CODE_REVIEW_RULES_DIR=/path/to/rules
```

A project rule package **replaces** the built-in package; it is not merged with it.

## What this is not

- Not a replacement for tests, CI, or human review.
- Not a guarantee that a clean report means the change is correct.
- Not a coverage tool: coverage is used when provided, not required.
- Not a fixer: it does not modify the code under review.

## Validation

<details>
<summary>11-case historical Java regression (2026-10-29)</summary>

- Baseline: commit `494a39bb`, before `behavior-review` was extracted into a standalone probe. The snapshot validates the shared finding and gate contract, not the four-probe split itself.
- 11/11 cases completed; static review.
- Original behavior targets: 5/5 hit; including two independently confirmed edge cases, 5/7 required targets were found.
- Clean and fixed controls: 4/4 passed without false blocking.
- Two confirmed edge-case misses remain: legal input formatting in a parser, and a JSON representation round-trip in command rendering.
- 33 raw findings: 8 high, 20 medium, 5 low; 0 confirmed false positives, with unverified items still open.
- The full merge gate was not run.

Risk areas exercised by these cases:

| Risk area | Cases | Observed result |
|---|---|---|
| Resource lifecycle | DBeaver | Found an input stream left open after copying; confirmed target. |
| Execution logic | Kestra, Keycloak guides | Found duplicate interpreter/command assembly in Kestra; confirmed target. Also reported switch fall-through in Keycloak, with downstream impact only partly supported. |
| Input boundaries and value handling | Lang-1, Spring AI Alibaba | Found hexadecimal overflow handling and blank-string sentinel problems; confirmed targets. The leading-zero return-type finding remained a contract dispute and was rated too high. |
| Permissions and data scope | Keycloak groups (m01), Elasticsearch | Found authorization resource IDs used as group IDs; confirmed target. The non-default filesystem permission-bypass candidate still needs threat-model and exploitability evidence. |
| API compatibility | Kestra | Identified public SPI return-type changes and new abstract methods; compatibility break supported, affected external plugins not measured. |
| Cache and state consistency | Keycloak login cache (m02) | Reported an invalidation risk involving organization-wrapped models; runtime consequences remain unverified. |
| Performance and repeated work | Elasticsearch, Kestra, Keycloak login cache | Reported logging overhead, repeated rendering/downloads, and extra lookups; performance impact was not benchmarked. |
| Test quality and regression protection | DBeaver, Keycloak, Kestra | Identified missing branch tests, tests bypassing the changed production entry point, and incorrect cleanup or cache-invalidation coverage. |

The two confirmed misses were Keycloak's valid `tileVisible = "false"`
syntax bypassing validation, and Kestra's JSON render/parse round-trip
corrupting command values containing quotes, backslashes, or newlines.

The four controls checked false alarms: the Lang-1 fix, normal pagination,
normal tag normalization, and a valid login-cache delegation path that should
not be reported as recursion. Passing a control does not establish that its
entire change is defect-free.

The evaluation harness and raw reports are kept out of the published repository. This snapshot is a regression result, not a claim of general recall.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. For a behavior change, include the review target (repo and base/head), expected and observed result or gate decision, and evidence that distinguishes them.

For a probe or schema change, update the probe document, output contract, and affected scripts together.

Run tests with `python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`; set `CODE_REVIEW_TEST_BASH` to include shell and installation checks. These tests do not call models or establish defect recall.

For user-facing changes, add an entry to `NEWS.md`. Pushes to `main` update the README news preview; locally, run `python scripts/news-update.py` and `python scripts/sync-news.py` (use `--check` to verify only). Keep the Chinese README aligned.
